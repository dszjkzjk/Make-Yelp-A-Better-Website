# Make-Yelp-A-Better-Website

This project is all about:
1. Use data mining techniques to identify pattern/relationship/correlation within the Yelp dataset 
2. Business-focus: focusing on improving the businesses that have a profile page on Yelp. Example: identify characteristics that are correlated with high/low review volume, identify characteristics that are correlated with high/low star ratings.
3. Review reader-focus: focusing on improving the experience of Yelp users. Example: identify characteristics that are correlated with high/low review helpfulness score, identify the bias in reviews.
